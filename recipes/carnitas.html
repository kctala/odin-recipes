    <p>These Instant Pot Carnitas will add some delicious spice to your summer or any time of year! Easily made juicy and tender in the Instant Pot and crispy under a broiler, this Mexican street food recipe is also Paleo, Whole30 and low FODMAP.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3-4 lbs pork shoulder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp garlic-infused olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pineapple juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup lime jice, freshly-squeezed (about 2 large limes)</li>
            <li>1 tsp lime zest</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano leaves</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp kosher salt, plus more for sprinking</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground cayenne powder</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a sharp chopping knife, chop the pork shoulder into 6 equal square-sized pieces. Dry each piece with paper towels and sprinkle generously with kosher salt and ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Hit the “Sauté” button on your Instant Pot Pressure Cooker and add the garlic-infused olive oil. Once the display reads “Hot,” using tongs, add half of the pork pieces and sear each side for 1 minute. Remove seared pork to a plate and repeat for the remaining pieces of pork.</li>
            <li>Once all the pork pieces are seared and removed from the pot, hit “Cancel” on the Instant Pot and slowly pour the pineapple and lime juice into the pot. Scrape the bottom of the pot clean with a plastic spoon.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tsp lime zest, 1 tsp oregano leaves, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/2 tsp cayenne powder to the pot and stir until combined. Add all the pork back into the pot and cover with the liquid on all sides. Scrape any pork juices left on the plate into the pot using a spatula (leave no flavour behind!).</li>
            <li>Close the lid, set pressure release valve to sealing, hit the “Meat” button, and set timer for 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the cooking cycle has completed, hit “Cancel” on the Instant Pot and quick release pressure. Preheat the oven broiler and set a rack to the second position from the top of the oven.</li>
            <li>Open the Instant Pot lid, and using a slotted spoon, carefully remove pork to a cookie sheet. Using two forks, pull pork apart and spread it evenly on the cookie sheet. Using a ladle, spread half of the juices remaining in the pot over the meat. Put the cookie sheet in the oven and broil for 4 minutes, watching carefully for burning. Remove cookie sheet from the oven and using a large flipping spatula, flip the pork on the cookie sheet. Add the remaining half of the juices on the pork and broil for 4 more minutes or until pork is crispy. Remove from the oven. Using tongs, remove pork from cookie sheet into a serving bowl, leaving most of the remaining juices behind on the cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>Serve in a bowl on some greens (Paleo, Whole30 and Low FODMAP), on a baked potato (Paleo, Whole30 and Low FODMAP), on a sweet potato (Paleo, Whole30 and Low FODMAP up to 1/2 cup), in a gluten-free corn tortilla (Low FODMAP up to 2-3 tortillas but not Paleo/Whole30, see above for more information), or in a Paleo/Whole30 compliant tortilla alternative (green leaf or butter lettuce, for example). Top with scallions (green tops only), chopped lettuce, compliant salsa, freshly-squeezed lime juice, lactose-free sour cream (Low FODMAP but not Paleo/Whole30) or any of your favourite toppings.</li>
